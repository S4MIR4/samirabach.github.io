Research
=========

My research focuses on computational chemistry and involves working with multi-electrode electrophysiological recordings, including MEG and EEG to enhance neuronal data analysis using various methods and improve real-time signal analysis for neurofeedback applications. 

<!-- In March 2022, I joined the Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics team as an electrophysiology pipeline development 
engineer consultant, with the goal of building open-source and computationally efficient processing pipelines to 
analyze large amounts of electrophysiological data.
Since July 2020, I have been working part-time at [CatalystNeuro](https://www.catalystneuro.com/), a consulting company 
with the mission of facilitating collaborations in neuroscience and standardizing data analysis and data storage 
solutions. 

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Bio Engineering Lab](https://bsse.ethz.ch/bel) at ETH, working on 
multimodal approaches to probe neural activity and to construct detailed biophysical models. Before that I was at the 
Center for Integrated Neuroplasticity [CINPLA](https://www.mn.uio.no/ibv/english/research/sections/fyscell/cinpla/), 
at the University of Oslo, where I received my PhD. -->
